### Introduction
One intriguing aspect of [Andrej Karpathy's](https://karpathy.ai/) recent introduction to Large Language Models caught my attention. He began integrating terms from cognitive psychology, such as "gestalt," "hallucination," and the first and second systems of thinking (as described in Daniel Kahneman's book). This suggests a potential shift toward more complex cognitive models in his work.

Incidentally, were you aware that the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/editorial/woty) named 'hallucinate' as the word of the year for 2023?
