# Corporate Structures of Software Development Companies in Ukraine

## Introduction

The Ukrainian software development industry has seen significant growth in recent years and has become one of the leading players in the global IT services market. The primary factor behind the success of Ukrainian IT companies is their effective corporate structures, which allow them to adapt to rapid market changes and efficiently manage resources. In this article, we will take a detailed look at the corporate structures of three leading Ukrainian IT companies – SoftServe, Luxoft, and Ciklum, and compare their similarities and differences.

## Corporate Structures of Companies

### SoftServe

SoftServe is one of the largest IT companies in Ukraine, with over 10,000 employees working in more than 30 offices worldwide. The corporate structure of SoftServe is a combination of functional and project-based models.

**Functional Structure:**
- **Development:** Includes teams of developers, architects, and engineers responsible for creating software.
- **Quality Assurance (QA):** Responsible for verifying the quality and functionality of products.
- **Marketing:** Responsible for promoting products to the market.
- **Sales:** Responsible for signing contracts and selling products and services.
- **HR and Finance:** Includes personnel management, financial planning, and control.

**Project-Based Structure:**

- Project teams operate independently, allowing for quick adaptation to client requirements.

### Luxoft

Luxoft, part of DXC Technology, specializes in providing IT services in various sectors, such as finance, automotive, and healthcare. Luxoft employs a matrix structure that combines elements of functional and project-based structures.

**Matrix Structure:**

- **Project Teams:** Each project consists of specialists from different functional divisions working on specific tasks.

**Advantages of Matrix Structure:**

- Ability to involve specialists from different functional divisions in projects.
- Balance between specialization and project-oriented results.

### Ciklum

Ciklum is a leading provider of outsourcing software development services and works with clients worldwide. The corporate structure of Ciklum is based on a project-based model.

**Project-Based Structure:**
- Each project has an independent team comprising developers, testers, project managers, and other necessary specialists.

- Project managers are responsible for coordinating the team’s work and interacting with clients.

## Comparison of Corporate Structures

3. **Flexibility:** All three companies demonstrate high flexibility in resource allocation and project management, which is a key success factor in the dynamic IT industry.

### Differences

   - Ciklum, although working with international clients, has fewer offices compared to SoftServe and Luxoft.

## Matrix Management: Trap and Advantages

The uncertainty regarding a company's ability to build effective processes based on a matrix management structure remains during the initial phases of a company’s transformation.

### Matrix Management Trap

The pitfalls of matrix management and its particular advantages can be explored in detail through the Harvard Review. For those not yet subscribed, I suggest adding it to your publication list. To summarize an excerpt: In practice, however, the matrix proved all but unmanageable—especially in an international context. Dual reporting led to conflict and confusion; the proliferation of channels created informational logjams as a proliferation of committees and reports bogged down the organization; and overlapping responsibilities produced turf battles and a loss of accountability.

Companies typically don’t consciously choose this problematic management form. Historical legacies and swift business decisions driven by investment indicators, often without readiness for in-depth analysis, lead to situations where “matrix management” controls numerous processes for extended periods.

### My Experience with Matrix Structure

In my professional experience, I’ve faced two types: establishing local representation and acquiring companies. The former, being less complex in terms of management, is more predictable. Although I can’t disclose specific companies, the company was mainly formed by the headquarters. Consequently, issues surrounding the establishment of common goals and a clear hierarchy were almost nonexistent. Management managed to avoid the disadvantages of a matrix management structure almost always, except for highly complex projects complicated further by cultural differences among the offices of a huge company. I’m curious to read future books that discuss how leadership handles such matters.

Acquiring companies leads to relatively long-term friction. Friction should reshape the acquired company. Much depends on how well-established the parent company is and how deeply it is willing to delve into the specifics of the acquired company. Changes in competencies, often significant shifts in goals, confusion in subordination, and uncertainty about the future can paralyze such a company. Hence, in my subjective view, it’s crucial to ‘plug in’ the company to an artificial life support system to stay ahead. I’ve seen changes in the leadership of the acquired company aimed at reducing resistance to changes and enhancing manageability. It’s a radical and common but effective solution. However, it’s essential to remember that such changes require a deep bench. Leaders sometimes leave a company suddenly or change their positions, and having timely replacements for them and their subordinates is crucial. Some leave immediately, needing just a ring, while others might take up to six months before joining competitors.

Transformation takes time, and delaying solutions to pressing issues only exacerbates the situation. Improving transformation is possible through simple steps: a transparent new structure, clear lines of responsibility, efforts towards material and immaterial motivation, achievable goals in the early stages—all of which need support from shareholders, devoid of rose-tinted glasses.

When reviewing materials on this topic, I was surprised by how long this trap has ensnared companies. The problem existed and was localized in the 1970s, in 2000, and in 2020. Like a flytrap, despite its primitive nature, it remains capable of ensnaring quick and more evolved insects.
